Introducing Portable Storage 3.

A mod that provides you with a variety of bags and holders to store your items.
With 16+ different bags, holding different kinds of items and auto picking them when gathered, it will become difficult to have your inventory flooded by the various loot you can obtain.
From specific ammo holders, general all-purpose bags, containers for special items (like ores, potions, fishes, etc...) to the mighty black hole absorbing items in range and auto sorting them into corresponding bags.
Items inside storages can still be used for crafting and quick usage as if they were in the inventory.
